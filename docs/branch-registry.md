# Branch registry

Inventory of all branches across the three locations: **upstream** (AtasPlatform/Indicators),
**origin** (AlbertoAmadorBelchistim/Indicators — combined backup of upstream + local work),
**local** (working machine).

Last full sync: **2026-03-29**
Last cleanup: **2026-03-29**

Column guide:
- **L** = exists in local | **O** = exists in origin | **U** = exists in upstream
- **Last U/O/L** = date of most recent commit in that location (`—` = not present)
- **Action** = recommended next action

## 1. Shared reference branches

Branches that exist in upstream AND are tracked locally. Must be kept in sync.

| Branch | Purpose | L | O | U | Last U | Last O | Last L | Sync status | Action |
|--------|---------|---|---|---|--------|--------|--------|-------------|--------|
| `Develop` | Upstream main dev branch. Base for all feat/fix branches. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 2026-03-26 | 2026-03-26 | 2026-03-26 | ✓ synced | Sync at session start |
| `publish_stable` | Last stable release from upstream | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 2025-06-17 | 2025-06-17 | 2025-06-17 | ✓ synced | Update after each stable release |

## 2. Upstream active branches (2025–2026)

Upstream feature branches with recent activity. Worth tracking in origin; evaluate for local.
